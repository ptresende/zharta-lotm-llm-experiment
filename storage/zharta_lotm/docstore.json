In other words, if they repay early, they will pay less.\nExample: Simulation of three alternative repayment dates of a 30-day maturity loan with 30 ETH principal and 27% APR:\n- Repayment day 3 => Interest = (7 / 365) x 27% x 30 ETH = 0.1553 ETH\n- Repayment day 15 => Interest = (15 / 365) x 27% x 30 ETH = 0.3328 ETH\n- Repayment day 30 => Interest = (30 / 365) x 27% x 30 ETH = 0.6657 ETH\nOur Multi-Tier feature allows Borrowers to choose different APR and LTV combinations according to a maximum loan period. The shorter the period, the higher the APR and LTV, and vice versa.\nWe structured our three tiers with specific borrower goals in mind. The fast-paced 7-day tier is designed to allow borrowers to extract maximum value from their NFTs over a short period while charging a higher APR. This option might be ideal for flippers with limited assets, for example. On the other hand, the 90-day tier offers a lower LTV while being considerably more cost-effective, presenting a good opportunity for borrowers with long-term prospects and enough collateral to easily attain the value they need.\nThanks to our pro-rata pricing, borrowers can, for example, leverage the lowest APR provided by the 90-day tier while paying only 7 days' worth of interest by repaying the loan early.\nTogether, these two features enable borrowers to mix and match options to find the combination that best suits their needs.\nZharta's Appraisal Model relies on a combination of Floor Prices and Trait Boosts to assess the value of collections and individual NFTs.\nThe Floor Price is an industry-standard metric for valuing a particular NFT collection. It corresponds to the lowest listed price for any item from that collection on various marketplaces.\nCurrently, our primary source for this critical data is Reservoir, which aggregates information from some of the most widely-used NFT marketplaces, including OpenSea, LooksRare, Rarible, Blur, and more (you can refer to the complete list here). In addition to Reservoir, our system draws from four other data sources, ensuring robustness and real-time accuracy. This approach guarantees that our valuation system remains reliable and continually up-to-date.\nTrait Boosts are selectively applied to specific traits within a given NFT collection, typically coinciding with the rarer and more valuable traits. Consequently, NFTs with these traits command a higher value.\nThe valuation of these rarer NFTs is calculated by multiplying the Floor Price of their collection by the boost factor associated with their most valuable trait. Conversely, \u2018common\u2019 NFTs within the collection are valued at the collection\u2019s standard Floor Price.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4260, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fefc6c3e-dc84-4f06-ac16-7fdd12f034e8": {"__data__": {"id_": "fefc6c3e-dc84-4f06-ac16-7fdd12f034e8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "80d55e51-b598-4054-871d-b39de9e97ca2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "71b17efaa684c822bccadf71bc9a2111886c1ad1bc414841cd758ef7dbba2316", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0079a769-08d9-4606-bf7e-b34ebdb40be4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9b1676615595213b1db6c4a50b21fcdda98f29ac40e96e50dea3d38bd5758f4f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7f3a6a61-2793-40fa-8dc3-6582c8dc847a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5de2c09b9724f6d411d37aa9371901db8d2823340d37a8fe2505cb4c8815874c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "e7b25ea040c399a6864cdf7830b6c1fd2191282e75b1da1dfa29ea925a924b95", "text": "Currently, our primary source for this critical data is Reservoir, which aggregates information from some of the most widely-used NFT marketplaces, including OpenSea, LooksRare, Rarible, Blur, and more (you can refer to the complete list here).

This model takes into consideration various factors, including the risk profile of each NFT collection, its price volatility across different timeframes, and prevailing conditions in both the lending and secondary markets. By factoring in these elements, our model dynamically adjusts the LTV to reflect the most up-to-date market conditions for a specific NFT collection. This ensures that all our loans are risk-adjusted in real time.\nWhen a borrower uses more than one NFT as collateral, the Loan LTV is derived from the collateral-weighted average LTV. The Collateral Value (CV) for each NFT is determined using the Appraisal Model we described previously.\nExample: Bundle loan with two assets as collateral from different NFT collections\n- Collateral Value: BAYC = 60 ETH , MAYC = 15 ETH\n- Loan LTV = (60 x 55% + 15 x 50%) / (60 + 15) = 54%", "start_char_idx": 3330, "end_char_idx": 5670, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7f3a6a61-2793-40fa-8dc3-6582c8dc847a": {"__data__": {"id_": "7f3a6a61-2793-40fa-8dc3-6582c8dc847a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aa6966fe-8bcc-4be9-a152-0a4eae87c13f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5de2c09b9724f6d411d37aa9371901db8d2823340d37a8fe2505cb4c8815874c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fefc6c3e-dc84-4f06-ac16-7fdd12f034e8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e7b25ea040c399a6864cdf7830b6c1fd2191282e75b1da1dfa29ea925a924b95", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b8739346-364b-4add-b11e-d67233f65686", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "905083e7dbe24c6be6f90becb29f53136e6814b48ca4911b6fe762de400a8cfa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "5de2c09b9724f6d411d37aa9371901db8d2823340d37a8fe2505cb4c8815874c", "text": "Comment on page\nSupported Collections\nWe are always evaluating the NFT landscape and adding new collections according to our metrics.

Sales are conducted on a first-come, first-served basis.\nIt's crucial to note that no investment is without risk. Ensure you thoroughly understand our protocol and risk management strategies before deciding to make a deposit.\nCurrently, we only support desktop devices. We recommend Google Chrome or Firefox for a better experience.\nNo. Borrowers will only be charged for the interest, which will be split between Zharta and the lending pool.\nYes. Our protocol supports EIP-1271, allowing for signature verification when an account is a smart contract. Zharta's smart contracts support Gnosis Safe multi-sig, but the dApp is not yet supported.\nNo. Zharta doesn't get custody of your assets. NFTs used as collateral are held in a smart contract escrow. This means that the assets are held by the smart contract itself, and are always subject to the pre-agreed business rules of the loan.\nSmart contracts are programs stored within the blockchain that work as self-executing contracts. Once the two parties agree upon the terms, these are coded into the contract and deployed to the blockchain, thus rendering the transaction irreversible, traceable, and transparent.\nNo. Our loans offer full protection from liquidation during the term of the loan. Your loan will only default if you fail to pay on time.\nNo. Interest is charged pro-rata \u2013 it accrues on a per-day basis. After a 7-day minimum, you'll only be charged for the days that elapse until you repay the loan.\nYes, you can bundle several assets into a single loan.\nYes. Zharta allows for non-custodial loans on top of decentralized smart contracts to take advantage of the strength, transparency, and security of the blockchain networks where your assets are located.\nIn a nutshell, Zharta's Appraisal Model utilizes Floor Prices and Trait Boosts to appraise NFTs. This means that more common NFTs will be valued at their collection's Floor Price, while rarer NFTs will be valued using a multiplier of their collection's Floor Price.\nTrait Boosts are only available for some collections.\nCheck out the Loan Conditions section of the app for more information about current Floor Prices and which collections are eligible for Trait Boosts.\nLiquidations only happen when a borrower fails to repay their loan on time. Once their loan term is over, they'll still get a 48-hour Grace Period during which they'll have a chance to repay their loan plus a penalty fee to get their NFTs back.\nShould the borrower still fail to repay within this Grace Period, the collateralized NFTs will proceed to a 48-hour Buy Now phase. Lenders from the respective pool will have the opportunity to purchase these NFTs at a discount on a first-come, first-served basis.\nIf no buyers emerge during this period, the NFTs will automatically be sold to a third party at their current market price.\nWe are always evaluating the market and adding new collections according to our metrics.

Not having to wait for Lenders to provide liquidity for each individual loan ensures a completely seamless process for Borrowers.\nPro Tip: Borrowers can bundle NFTs, including those from different collections, into a single Loan\nUsing multiple NFTs as collateral for a single loan increases the amount you can borrow at once, improving gas efficiency.\nHere, you'll be able to see which of your NFTs can be used as collateral (you can also view these in your Dashboard). Select the NFTs you want to use for your loan.\nIf you have a lot of supported NFTs, you can use our filters to sort through them more easily\nYou can choose between 3 loan terms - each with its own LTVs and APRs. You can check the conditions for each collection/loan term here, but a good rule of thumb is that the shorter the term, the higher the LTVs and APRs.\nAs you might have noticed in the earlier steps, the loan principal automatically changes to the max you can borrow depending on the selected NFTs and loan period.\nOnce you\u2019ve settled on the collateral and loan term you want, you can adjust this value manually.\nWhen you're done, double-check the loan summary.

You\u2019ll only need to do this once per collection \u2013 it will appear as \u201cApproved\u201d in future loans.\nThis step is necessary so the protocol has permission to move your NFTs into a Smart Contract Escrow once you confirm the loan (your NFTs won\u2019t be moved before then).\nNext, you\u2019ll decide whether you want to use Delegation.\nDelegation allows you to continue to use your NFTs' utility, such as accessing gated Discord servers and using them for gaming. It's important to note that some collections may limit what you can do using Delegation.\nSince this feature increases gas costs, we recommend only using it when you know you\u2019ll need it.\nFinally, you\u2019ll get another chance to review your loan before approving it.\nOnce you click Approve, you\u2019ll be prompted to authorize it in your Wallet as well.\nAfter that, just give the blockchain a moment to do its thing\u2026\n\u2026and that\u2019s it!\nPro-tip: You can add your email at the end of the loan flow to receive notifications about upcoming deadlines.\nAfter this last step, the Borrower will be prompted to submit an email to receive notifications regarding the ongoing loan.

collections. These traits can serve to distinguish NFTs within a particular collection or fulfill specific roles in the collection's ecosystem.\nAs a result, NFTs within the same collection may vary in terms of rarity and value, contingent upon their unique traits. Consequently, we incorporate this information when assessing the value of NFTs as collateral.\nOur approach primarily aims to closely approximate the value of any given NFT to its 'real' or 'fair' value, recognising that achieving precise estimation is inherently challenging.\nHence, our methodology revolves around analysing the multipliers that specific traits exhibit when compared to 'floor' NFTs within the collection. 'Floor' NFTs are those that lack rarer or more valuable traits.\nTo accomplish this, we segment the available sales data of a given collection into equal time periods and observe the impact of different trait values on the sales value.\nValue of sales of the \"Fur\" trait of the BAYC collection\nThe example above illustrates the outcome for the 'Fur' trait within the BAYC collection. On the y-axis, you can observe the 'floor ratio,' which is calculated by dividing the sales value of NFTs featuring that particular trait by the floor price of the collection at the corresponding moment.\nIn this instance, we have established that each time period spans three months, and we aggregate sales data based on the 10th percentile of sales for the trait in question. We consider this approach to be both conservative and reflective of real-world conditions.\nAfter applying the aforementioned methodology to several selected NFT collections, determining the final trait boost requires additional considerations. These considerations encompass:\ni) The fluctuation of multipliers associated with specific traits over time. ii) The statistical significance of the trait boost, taking into account factors such as the number of sales and the time elapsed since the last sale within the sample. iii) The desirability of the NFT collection and the specific trait in the secondary market. iv) Cross-referencing with third-party valuation multiples for validation, among other relevant factors.\nUtilising this information, a discount (or, where applicable, a cap) is applied to the model's trait boost, resulting in the final assessed value.\nFor additional details about the Trait Boosts applicable to the chosen collections, please refer to the Loan Conditions section in the app.\nWhenever we appraise an NFT, we look at the floor price of the collection at that time, at the traits that the particular NFT has and at the boosts that we have set up for its collection.\nThe resulting appraisal is either:\nAppraisal = Floor Price(in case the NFT does not have any boosted trait)\nAppraisal = Floor Price * Trait Boost(otherwise)", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2911, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b23c5fd0-b941-4d1b-8951-2f7a141d2f96": {"__data__": {"id_": "b23c5fd0-b941-4d1b-8951-2f7a141d2f96", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "42d192f3-00d6-43fd-aba7-1ba81d1bb217", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b02a48f3c7025d4024da2c06885f041dd8b4a6b5e6d13e7a5fbfc80fb73c3d92", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2d4bdcf3-6c76-4b74-8b8d-608e5793d639", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b79359b064ed3b75906c526bf2b1814322ecf8dc34e0d6c253eec2988f022960", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9063a974-04c3-4169-8ead-122e4a77d0f9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cef659e970ee62bd8f3bf05ad83404c243d36b089f4524165aa9a05bbae02e55", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "b02a48f3c7025d4024da2c06885f041dd8b4a6b5e6d13e7a5fbfc80fb73c3d92", "text": "Comment on page\nStability Controls\nLayer of automated risk management\nIn order to guarantee the stability of our protocol and pools, we've designed a set of Stability Controls that are considered by the protocol whenever a new loan origination arises.

Each domain is comprised of two smart contracts, the Core and the Periphery.\nThe Core contracts define the data structures and the necessary storage for the domain. They are less flexible contracts and can be viewed as the database of the domain. Within each domain, the Core contract methods can only be called by their corresponding Periphery contract.\nThe Periphery contracts define the protocol logic and are the gateway to interact with the domain. Each Periphery contract can interact with several other Periphery contracts. They provide fundamental safety guarantees for parties interacting with Zharta and provide permissionless publicly-callable methods for each specific domain.\nThe Periphery contracts are more easily changed since they hold no storage variables, they only hold protocol logic. Since the domain storage exists in the domain-specific Core contract, it is easier to deploy a new domain-specific Periphery contract and point it to the Core contract and vice-versa.\nThis architecture is mentioned as data separation in Ethereum Docs. It has the purpose of easing the smart contracts upgrades, allowing fot faster bug fixing (including security issues) and business logic iterations. Even if the long term goal is protocol immutability, it is important at this stage to allow upgradability.\nZharta V1 is divided into the following domains:\nDomain\nLogic\nData\nLoans\nLoans\nLoansCore\nLending Pool (LP)\nLendingPoolPeripheral\nLendingPoolCore\nCollateral Vault (CV)\nCollateralVaultPeripheral\nCollateralVaultCore / CryptoPunksVaultCore\nLiquidations\nLiquidationsPeripheral\nLiquidationsCore\nLiquidity Controls (LC)\nLiquidityControls\nZharta is launching the V1 of the protocol with the following restrictions:\n- 1.Maturity-based loans with a maximum of 30 days\n- 2.One single lending pool of ETH/WETH\n- 3.No liquidations before a loan's maturity date\nAs said above, the protocol domains are separated into logic and data contracts. This is relevant because it allows for the upgradeability of the protocol. For the next version of the protocol, our goal is to deploy an immutable protocol but for that to be done efficiently, we first need to understand what users want and need and iterate over that. Zharta is the only party with the power to upgrade the protocol and we will always listen to our community and develop Zharta's protocol openly.\nAs previously stated, each domain is composed of a Core and Periphery pair of contracts. This composition is represented in the diagram as a strong coupling between those contracts.\nIn addition, V1 is designed so that for each ERC20 token that the lenders can deposit and borrowers can borrow from the protocol, an isolated lending market (ILM) comprised of the Core and Periphery contract pairs is deployed for the Loans and LP domains. This means that for each LP contract pair (Core and Periphery), there is a specific Loans contract pair (Core and Periphery), and only the specific Loans Periphery contract can interact with the LP Periphery contract.\nAs for the CV, Liquidations and Liquidity Controls domains are not specific to each ERC20 token and serve all the deployed ILMs.\nThe loan creation flow has two steps:\n- 1.Zharta's API pre-validation\n- the borrower should call Zharta's APIs beforehand to get the conditions for the loan given the NFTs chosen to be used as collateral\n- Zharta's API also validates the loan request and signs an ERC712 message\n- Zharta's portal simplifies this for now\n- 2.The loan is created on-chain by the borrower, using the signed message which is validated by the loan's smart contract\nIn the diagrams below, the coloured boxes (i.e. boxes that don\u2019t have a white background) represent smart contracts.\nThe loans can only be defaulted if and only if the borrower didn't repay the loan by the end of the maturity date.\nAlthough this may change in the future, as of the first iteration of the protocol, the loan defaults can only be triggered by Zharta.\nLiquidation Periods\nThe liquidation periods are periods where only certain actors can take part in the liquidation of the collateral:\n- Grace period: only for the borrower\n- Buy Now period: only for the lenders\nWhen the Liquidation Periods End", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4739, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3f625749-434f-4e32-827e-d6fa91ecf55d": {"__data__": {"id_": "3f625749-434f-4e32-827e-d6fa91ecf55d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d499f658-d6b0-4ae8-8026-37d7e2223938", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "089f0b483a794ba00fa486f580f0cde5f2a2ed045d935a1b31e5987884a9ef25", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a77fe9d4-1637-4a58-9b22-d8b074a03702", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7f3dcf29ea21e21f6a58221c2d8a16102d2d4806ec2d11dbbe7a7702d1706217", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d3410404-7cc3-4bb0-b2cf-e3459f19b3ed", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fd7a52f20bf833f38907e4386d316b8be442f309312ba36e42a8b728031e2690", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "089f0b483a794ba00fa486f580f0cde5f2a2ed045d935a1b31e5987884a9ef25", "text": "Comment on page\nContract Addresses\nETH Pool\nContract\nAddress\nLP Peripheral\nLP Core\nLoans Peripheral\nLoans Core\nCollateral Vault Core\nCryptopunks Vault Core\nCollateral Vault Peripheral\nLiquidations Peripheral\nLiquidations Core\nLiquidity Controls\nUSDC Pool\nContract\nAddress\nLP Peripheral\nLP Core\nLoans Peripheral\nLoans Core\nCollateral Vault Core\nCryptopunks Vault Core\nCollateral Vault Peripheral\nLiquidations Peripheral\nLiquidations Core\nLiquidity Controls\nGrails Pool\nContract\nAddress\nLP Peripheral\nLP Core\nLoans Peripheral\nLoans Core\nCollateral Vault Core\nCryptopunks Vault Core\nCollateral Vault Peripheral\nLiquidations Peripheral\nLiquidations Core\nLiquidity Controls", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 668, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3410404-7cc3-4bb0-b2cf-e3459f19b3ed": {"__data__": {"id_": "d3410404-7cc3-4bb0-b2cf-e3459f19b3ed", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7ef14812-8c0b-4a9a-b36e-816fb16f101d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fd7a52f20bf833f38907e4386d316b8be442f309312ba36e42a8b728031e2690", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3f625749-434f-4e32-827e-d6fa91ecf55d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "089f0b483a794ba00fa486f580f0cde5f2a2ed045d935a1b31e5987884a9ef25", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "94ebca2f-fa27-4eb8-afdd-20b04a88c432", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f68f55a225b30e971077a21eb00bdf86900997e81c224fdae08c144a30346908", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "fd7a52f20bf833f38907e4386d316b8be442f309312ba36e42a8b728031e2690", "text": "Comment on page\nProtocol Fees\nZharta's business model is quite simple: under normal conditions, we take 25% of all Interest Payments and Penalty Fees generated by the Protocol.

Some holders, for example, have Kodas they\u2019re not using, while others wish they had a stronger team to fulfill certain objectives. By enabling players to easily rent assets to each other, we allow them to maximize their strategies and returns without having to buy or sell.\nWe got a lot of valuable feedback from our users after launching V1. We decided to use the hiatus between seasons to get a head-start in incorporating some of the most requested upgrades and new features:\n- Reduced gas costs\n- Self-delegation - use your listed assets while they're not being rented\n- Delegate to another wallet - pay with one wallet, play with the other\n- Otherdeed support - list or rent land\nIf you prefer to use one Wallet for payments and another to store your assets, this option will enable you to pay with one and play with the other, allowing you to manage your Wallets as you see fit.\nWhen you list an asset, the protocol places it in a Safe Vault and, from there, delegates it to the players who rent it. Thanks to Self-Delegation, instead of your assets sitting idle while you wait for someone to rent them, you can use them yourself \u2013 all without having to unlist or withdraw them.\nKeep in mind that, if you don\u2019t unlist an asset before Self-Delegating, it may be rented at any time \u2013 potentially interrupting whatever you were using it for.\nV2 of our Otherside Renting protocol includes new, upgraded Smart Contracts that, among other things, enable the new features we discussed above. By migrating your Odas, you\u2019ll simply be moving them from the old Smart Contracts to the new ones. To ease the transition, and as a \"thank you\" to our early users, we\u2019ll be refunding the gas fees associated with migration.\nMigration gas costs will be refunded for all migrations performed until December 17 at 11:59 PM.\nJust go to the \u201cYour Assets\u201d section of our platform. Decide which asset you\u2019d like to rent out and click \u201cDeposit and List.\u201d Decide the listing conditions (such as rental rate and max duration) you want to offer. Confirm the listing, and that\u2019s it \u2013 your asset is now available for others to rent!\nGo to the \u201cAll Assets\u201d section of our platform. Browse the Available Assets (you can filter and sort them according to your needs) and click \u201cRent Now\u201d on the one you want. Choose the duration of your rental, double-check the conditions, and pay \u2013 you\u2019ll be able to use the rented asset right away!\nOnce you deposit and list an asset, it will go into a Safe Vault. From there, it can be safely Delegated to other players\u2019 Wallets. Delegation allows other Wallets to use an NFT\u2019s utility \u201cremotely,\u201d without any transfer occurring \u2013 renters never have your assets in their possession. Your asset will only leave the Safe Vault when you withdraw it!\nConsider the purpose you have for this Oda. Doing so will help you narrow your search down. If, for example, you need an Oda for farming, you can ignore fighting-related stats. After having a list of viable options, balance their prices against their advantages and choose accordingly.\nHere are the main characteristics you\u2019ll want to consider:\n- Rental rate\n- Minimum/maximum duration: the maximum duration should be sufficient to achieve your goals. You can cancel your rental and get a refund for the unused time, but you\u2019ll always at least pay for the minimum duration, so keep that in mind as well.\n- Mara traits: abilities, attack damage/speed, harvest bonus, rarity tier, etc\n- Koda traits: similar to the Maras', but more complex. Kodas have two abilities each, for example, and some of them wield weapons \u2013 not to mention that a rare few are Mega Kodas.\n- Koda weapons: don\u2019t just check whether a Koda has a weapon \u2013 each weapon has its own characteristics that affect gameplay differently.\n- Special ability cooldown: ensure the abilities you want to use are either not in cooldown or will refresh in time for you to use them.\nIt\u2019s up to each player to decide how much they want to charge.\nWhen building our blockchain protocol, we ensured our smart contracts were 100% secure so there was no possibility of obstruction.

The protocol is a trustless way for LOTM players to rent game assets from users.\nThere are two major domains in the protocol:\n- the vaults\n- the renting logic\nThe Renting a game asset in the context of this protocol means that a user deposits the asset in a vault and the\nVersion\nLanguage\nReference implementation\nV1\nVyper 0.3.9\nThere are two major domains in the protocol:\n- the vaults\n- the renting logic\nThe renting of an NFT in the context of this protocol means that:\n- 1.an asset owner deposits the NFT in a vault, setting the terms of the rental: price and minimum/maximum rental duration\n- 2.a user (renter) selects the NFT put for rental and starts the rental by paying for the rental upfront\n- 3.the vault where the NFT asset is escrowed delegates it to the renter's wallet for a specific duration\n- 4.once the duration of the rental is reached, the rental finishes\nThe current status of the protocol follows certain assumptions that must be validated as more information about LOTM is released.\nThe assumptions are the following:\nBelow are the smart contract audits performed for the protocol so far:\nAs previously stated, there are two domains of the protocol:\nUsers and other protocols should always interact with the\nRenting.vy contract. The\nRenting.vy contract is the entry point of the protocol and it is responsible for:\n- NFT owners deposit NFTs in the protocol, which means a vault is created for each NFT\n- NFT owners define the terms of the rentals: price and minimum/maximum rental duration\n- renters starting rentals\n- renters closing rentals before the due date\n- NFT owners claiming unclaimed fees\n- NFT owners withdrawing NFTs from the protocol\nEach NFT put for rental needs to be in its own vault (see the 3rd point in General considerations). This means that when an NFT owner wants to deposit an NFT in the protocol, the NFT owner may need to create the vault prior to depositing the NFT. If the vault for that specific NFT has already been created, it can be reused.\nNFT owners do not need to create the vaults themselves, the protocol will create the vaults when needed.\nThe protocol creates the vaults using minimal proxies and the\nCREATE2 opcode. This means that when a vault for a specific NFT needs to be created, the protocol is able to compute the destination address of the vault before creating it and the user may approve the NFT to be transferred. Therefore, creating the vault and depositing the NFT can be done atomically.\nWhenever a rental starts, the renter pays the full amount of the rental upfront. This amount is locked in the NFT vault until the end of the rental. Once the rental finishes, the rental amount is released to the NFT owner for claiming. Since the protocol is using warm.xyz which supports setting a specific timestamp for the end of the delegation, the protocol computes the amount of fees that are claimable taking this into consideration. Unclaimed fees are only set explicitly for certain actions:\n- 1.\nclaim: the NFT owner claims unclaimed fees\n- 2.\nwithdraw: the NFT owner withdraws the NFT from the vault, along with any unclaimed fees\n- 3.\nstart_rental: a renter starts the rental and the previous rental fees, if not claimed, are set explicitly as unclaimed\n- 4.\nclose_rental: a renter may finish a rental before its due date and he pays only for the time used, and unclaimed fees are explicitly set", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3457, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8bd57aa7-beb0-4642-9e79-4a6d3a8f6fb3": {"__data__": {"id_": "8bd57aa7-beb0-4642-9e79-4a6d3a8f6fb3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "19e1d597-f0da-488e-b10a-79bf8c636a38", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5a285889a35cacdd3e6431e3f492219a310cc5676b06cd86b5df514c2900561f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "42d12a0b-0725-41be-a03d-f2ae787cfb0e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c339d7c72107dfa626de1f5bb56d1499531a69c9a16336d40d5c0516f3e82527", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9d191c40-c8b4-4d42-88d4-aa3239a4b293", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "345712ce172aca2bf08776a91bde6c1602e0e20e9e364a84940619f491c0545a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "5a285889a35cacdd3e6431e3f492219a310cc5676b06cd86b5df514c2900561f", "text": "Zharta Documentation\nSearch\n\u2303\nK\nOVERVIEW\nIntroducing Zharta\nManifesto\nTeam\nNFT Lending\nZharta Lending Offer\nSupported Collections\nFAQ \u2013 Lending\nAs a Borrower\nAs a Lender\nRisk Management\nProtocol -

In others words, the APR is the yearly cost of the loan, calculated as a percentage of the sum borrowed.\nThe annual percentage yield (APY) is the rate of return earned on an investment over a year, taking into account the effect of compounding interest.\nThe percentage of a pool\u2019s liquidity that has been loaned out.\nThe ratio between the loan amount and the value of the collateral being used. Often used to assess lending risk and, consequently, calculate interest rates.\nAmount of funds borrowed. In a loan, the total amount the borrower will have to pay back includes the principal plus interest (and any other added fees).\nOne or more assets are pledged as security for the repayment of a loan. Its purposes are to ensure that the borrower has a vested interest in repaying the loan and that the lender is less likely to incur a loss even if the borrower defaults (i.e., is unable to repay the loan).\nOver-collateralization refers to the provision of collateral that is worth more than the value of the loan by a good margin. Similarly, Hyper-collateralization occurs when the value of the collateral is largely out of proportion to the amount borrowed, resulting in a low LTV.\nNFT-backed loans, as is the case with crypto-backed loans, are always over-collateralized and often hyper-collateralized in order to protect lenders against market volatility.\nA borrower enters default if they fail to meet the conditions of a loan - typically by failing to repay the loan on time or, in the case of instalment loans, failing to meet the repayment schedule.\nEverything related to asset valuation.\nEssentially, a bunch of tokens provided by different investors that are locked by smart contracts and bundled together. Those funds can then be used to enable decentralized transactions - in Zharta\u2019s case, lending - that have the potential to generate returns, which are then split amongst the investors. Using a pool can automate liquidity mining for lenders and help mitigate risk - they do, however, require appropriate moderation by the platform to avoid liquidity issues.\nWhen a user sends an NFT to another user without receiving any tokens in exchange.\nThe process for creating an NFT. An NFT is minted when a unique token associated with an asset is published on the blockchain.\nMint transfers can be valueless (in cases where mints are not associated with a sale) or they can happen in exchange for a given amount of tokens (in cases when mints are triggered by sales, and hence happen within the same transfer in the blockchain).\nMints always happen from the NULL address (0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000) to another given address.\nMints can be executed for a single NFT or for multiple NFTs at once. In the latter case, a single transfer is registered in the blockchain, not multiple.\nThe opposite of minting - the moment after which the token seizes to exist on the blockchain. Burn transfers are always valueless.\nBurns always happen from the owners' address to the NULL address (0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000).\nBurns can be executed for a single NFT or for multiple NFTs at once. In the latter case, only a single transfer is registered in the blockchain, not multiple.\nPrograms stored within the blockchain work as self-executing contracts. Once the two parties agree upon the terms, these are coded into the contract and deployed into the blockchain, thus rendering the transaction irreversible, traceable and transparent.\nIn principle, anyone can code a smart contract. Since not everyone can code, however, they are often generated by third-party companies or software.\nEscrow is a legal arrangement in which a third party temporarily holds a bond, asset, or document until the terms pre-agreed to by both transacting parties are met.\nIn loans made at Zharta, the escrow is held by the smart contract.\nIn lending, a custodian is a third party that holds on to assets, funds, or documents for safekeeping until the conditions for their release are met.\nIn the case of collateralized loans, a third party typically takes custody of the collateral until either the borrower finishes their repayments, in which case the collateral returns to the borrower, or they enter default, at which point the collateral becomes property of the lender.\nIn a non-custodial platform like Zharta, however, no third party takes custody of the collateral. This has been made possible by blockchain technology and smart contracts and ensures that neither borrower, lender, or platform can act maliciously, since the collateral is held out of their reach until the contract\u2019s pre-agreed conditions are fulfilled.\nBlue Chip NFTs are generally valuable, well-known, well-established, and stable, and are therefore usually considered safer investments.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4867, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "10e83e7b-d0a5-4527-807a-a5b90c5387ca": {"__data__": {"id_": "10e83e7b-d0a5-4527-807a-a5b90c5387ca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c107f76e-0755-4e1d-a487-34ec8dfa422a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fa326dec6dfe9803500d1b5e753a116a2090b704d6fd846c75d049ac30d14de8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e277bcb6-cc40-4fea-a9ee-daf514563025", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e32fd0793222673e49943b27d189fcceb56138a9a1f1220a1606b296c1bcd19", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "b2184a98ec7a0a32660d1dd3768f5e1c1fc5c145ec0bcb6bec964e664fe1a5de", "text": "In loans made at Zharta, the escrow is held by the smart contract.\nIn lending, a custodian is a third party that holds on to assets, funds, or documents for safekeeping until the conditions for their release are met.\nIn the case of collateralized loans, a third party typically takes custody of the collateral until either the borrower finishes their repayments, in which case the collateral returns to the borrower, or they enter default, at which point the collateral becomes property of the lender.\nIn a non-custodial platform like Zharta, however, no third party takes custody of the collateral.

One NFT might surge in value, for example, but because its collection is new or not well known, there is less guarantee that its value will hold.\nIn Peer-to-Peer lending, one person borrows from another without involving a financial institution as a middleman.\nPeer-to-Pool lending works similarly, but instead of getting a loan from another person, the borrower takes liquidity from a pool in which several lenders have invested.\nBoth options have advantages and disadvantages. In Peer-to-Peer, for example, a lender might get higher interest rates, or the borrower may be able to negotiate more favourable terms. In Peer-to-Pool, while lenders share the returns, this is also true of the risk, which is therefore mitigated. For the borrower, Peer-to-Pool allows access to instant loans in which the conditions are given in real-time, cutting out the time and work that finding and negotiating with a lender entails.\nAn investment strategy in the DeFi space in which investors provide liquidity to a DeFi platform/application and receive rewards in return, such as a share of the platform\u2019s fees.\nIt is important to distinguish between instant NFT loans from NFT flash loans.\nIn instant loans, like those that happen here at Zharta, a borrower requests a loan, provides collateral, and is immediately presented with conditions for a smart contract which, should they accept, will give them instant liquidity from a pool of lenders. They then repay the loan within the time frame they agreed to - a week, a month, two months, etc.\nFlash loans don\u2019t require collateral, but they must be repaid, or the assets returned, in a matter of seconds. If this sounds impossible for a human to accomplish, that\u2019s because it essentially is. Flash loans are usually aimed at developers who can code their transactions in advance so that they execute all their steps in time.\nNFT Flash Loans apply this principle to borrowing NFTs instead of capital. The borrower might want to do this to reap a particular benefit from that NFT, like acquiring an NCT token, before the NFT returns to its original owner.\nThere are already some tools so that people who can\u2019t or do not wish to code can use flash loans.\nThe end product of a blockchain protocol that has been fully developed and deployed and is available for public use. The product might still be subject to changes at this stage, however, whenever updates are deemed necessary.\nAn alternative to the Mainnet used for testing. Testnet assets have no real value, which allows developers and beta testers to test the product without having to use real coins.\nThe total liquidity that is currently locked in smart contracts.",
